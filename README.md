## 🌟 Overview

Food Flow is an innovative platform designed to tackle two critical issues simultaneously: food waste and hunger. By creating a seamless connection between restaurants with surplus food and NGOs working to feed communities in need, we're building a more sustainable and compassionate food ecosystem.
